# Swappy

Swap two items around a comma.

## Why?

Ever realize that you have passed params to a function in the wrong order? Then you have to cut and paste and adjust the commas and by the end of it you are exhausted and have killed your productivity and are considering giving up programming altogether. This extension solves that problem, so you can keep your morale and productivity high.
